Multiplatform Kotlin Graph Library


### Operators:
* Boolean = Vertex in Graph
* Boolean = Vertex !in Graph
* Graph += Vertex
* Graph_1 += Graph_2 (if yuo need graph in vertex use addVertices)
* NewGraph = Graph + Vertex
* NewGraph = Graph_1 + Graph_2 (if yuo need graph in vertex use addVertices)
* Graph -= Vertex
* NewGraph = Graph - Vertex
